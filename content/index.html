What is this all about
======================

I once read that there are two job markets. The one where you have to put in a résumé and hopefully get an interview and then there is the one where people want you. This site is about me and how I make the transition from novice to expert in programming and learn to be a better person while I'm at it.

{% from "macros.j2" import render_excerpt with context %}
<section class="blog_excerpt">
{% set latest = site.content.walk_resources_sorted_by_time()|first %}

{% if latest -%}

{% refer to latest.url as article %}
Latest Blog post: <a href="{{content_url(latest.url)}}">{{latest.meta.title}}</a>

{{ article.excerpt|markdown|typogrify }}
