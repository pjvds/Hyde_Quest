About
=====


## Me: ##
Hello, my name is Mandaris Moore. I'm this guy... you know... Anyway, I've been messing around on the internet for a while. I'm interested in a lot of things; mac programming, accessible web design and self improvement.

*Self improvement* For most of my life, I've been plagued with low self-esteem and questions about who I am and what I want to do with my time on this planet. In recent years I've narrowed my goals to the following priorities:

1. Be a good father
2. Be the best person I can be

The second goal feed into the first but it's important that I put the children first.

## Site: ##
This site used to be hosted on Google's blogger, but with recent changes in how people communicate on the internet, I wanted more control over my voice on the web. I know that a lot of people enjoy social media sites such as twitter and facebook, but I wanted to have a place where my long form thoughts can be all my own.

The site design is based off of the beginner's tutorial created by [Merlin RebroviÄ‡][0] for the [Hyde project][1]. It is included in Hyde as a layout named _starter_.
If you have a [default Hyde installation][2], all you have to do is
write:

    hyde -s folder_name create -l starter

To check for the newest version, to download it separately or to report
a bug, please visit Hyde Starter Kit's [GitHub page][3].
