Interesting Sites
====================

I do a lot of reading/goofing off on the internet. I figured that if you were interested in what I do then you maybe interested in what I'm into.


Friends

[Prine.org](http://prine.org)  -  Sierra  
This is the site for one of my best friends. He's into photography.

Another great friend who helped usher me into mac fanboyism!

Great friend who I talk comic shop and other stuff with.

Mac

[Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net) -  
Honestly, I'm more of a Gruber fanboi than a mac fanatic.

[Mac Power Users](http://macpowerusers.com) -  
This is a podcast about how to make the most of your mac. I very rarely miss and episode.
