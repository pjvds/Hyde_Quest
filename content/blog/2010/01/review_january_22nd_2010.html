This week, I’ve been really ill. Maybe it’s all the stress that I’ve been under: Looking for a new place to live, Asking for a raise, unresolved issues with my family, weird sleeping schedule (the kids), pressure to produce _something_!
{%- endmark %}
Anyway, here’s a quick review:

Accomplishments:  
* Asked for a raise (Which was quickly followed by questions of "How do you do that special XYZ thing you do?") 
* Keep my head when I found out my account information was used to make some weird purchases 
* Make a post to email-init to further information about email clients

Things on my mind:  
* Find a place to live 
* Work on my personal relationships 
* Do a deeper review than this

Basically the same thing as last week
