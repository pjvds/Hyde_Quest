{% mark excerpt -%}So I'm taking an Operating Systems class at Sac State and the first feeling is fear. It's been a long time since I've sat down to learn something completely different from what I've done before and I've lost track of that feeling of excitement and discovery when it comes to coding.{%- endmark %}

True, I do a little bit of coding for work and have kept busy by doing little example programs here and there. 

True, I've been attempting to get myself ready for the class by doing simple exercises with gdb.

But, I can't shake my self doubts. I feel like I'm being followed by a huge shadow that constantly sings a chorus of "You're not good enough", "You're gonna fail", "If you were smarter, you wouldn't have to do this in the first place."

Breathe... 

I'm going to make it... Somehow...
